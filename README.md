# matlab-to-physicloud
A repository of Matlab code for interacting with a PhysiCloud instance.

This code facilitates easy interaction with cyber-physical resources across an instance of [PhysiCloud](http://github.com/hypower-org/physicloud).
In order to connect Matlab with PhysiCloud, a PhysiCloud client must be launched within your Matlab workspace. 
After its creation, the cyber-physical resources are available through simple function calls.

Documentation is coming soon!
